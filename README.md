# virtual-library

Developed the virtual panoramic roaming and navigation system for Main Library of my undergraduate university for peopleâ€™s visit during COVID-19.

Use the tool tour_testingserver and open tour.xml on your brower.

You can see a virtual university library systemwith functions of route design, automatic navigation, radar map, video introduction, terminal screen self-adaptation, etc.

Due to the uploading restriction, panos resources are not complete, the panoramic pictures are created by Insta360, if you are interested in it, pls feel free to contact me.
